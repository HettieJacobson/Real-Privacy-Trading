## Scene 1: Introduction

Welcome to Real Privacy Trading, a decentralized platform that revolutionizes asset trading through Fully Homomorphic Encryption. Built on FHEVM technology, this platform enables traders to execute orders with complete confidentiality of volumes, prices, and portfolio balances.

## Scene 2: Privacy Concept Explanation

Traditional trading platforms expose your transaction amounts and prices, making your strategy vulnerable to front-running and surveillance. With FHE-based trading, all sensitive data remains encrypted on-chain. Your trading volumes, order prices, and portfolio balances are computed without ever being decrypted, ensuring true privacy while maintaining full blockchain transparency.

## Scene 3: Wallet Connection & Setup

Let me demonstrate the platform in action. First, I'll connect my MetaMask wallet to the Sepolia testnet. The connection is instant and secure, maintaining privacy throughout the authentication process.

## Scene 4: Live Trading Demonstration

Now let's execute a live trade. I'll place a quick buy order for one hundred units of the BTC/ETH trading pair. Notice how the transaction is submitted with encrypted parameters. I'm confirming this transaction through MetaMask, which will interact with our deployed smart contract on the Sepolia blockchain.

The transaction is now confirmed. Here's the actual transaction hash on Etherscan, proving this is a real blockchain interaction, not a simulation. You can verify every detail of this transaction on the Sepolia network.

Let's check the portfolio section. My encrypted balance has been updated, showing the new position without revealing the exact amount to external observers. The platform also includes an anonymous feedback system where users can rate features and submit suggestions while maintaining complete privacy.

## Scene 5: Smart Contract Evidence

This is the verified smart contract deployed on Sepolia testnet. The contract address is shown here, along with recent transactions and the complete source code. You can explore the privacy-preserving functions including place order, quick buy, quick sell, and encrypted portfolio queries. Every interaction is verifiable on-chain while maintaining user confidentiality.
